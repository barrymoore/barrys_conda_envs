# barrys_conda_envs

This is a collection of conda environments that I use on my MacBook
laptop and across various linux servers.  This is mostly for backup
and archive for my own use, but also for sharing with colleagues.  If
you've stumbled across them you are welcome use them if they are
useful to you.
